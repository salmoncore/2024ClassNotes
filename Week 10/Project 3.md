**Objective:** Testing *Budget Buddy*

---

1. Unit testing
	1. BB has some Jest already
	2. JUnit needs to be added as well
	3. Mockito
	4. JaCoCo - coverage goal of 75%
	5. SonarCloud implementation
	6. Burp Suite
	7. Manual code review
		1. Quality gates for JaCoCo - 75% coverage is one quality gate
		2. We then also review the code on Github (the manual component)
2. Other tests
	1. Selenium
	2. Cucumber
	3. Performance testing
		1. JMeter implementation

**We need to come up with additional automated/manual quality gates as well.**

For adding tests - don't worry about stock or pladservice(?)
