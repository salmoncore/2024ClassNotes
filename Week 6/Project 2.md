# Partners have been assigned!

We're choosing **one** of our group projects for project 2. 
Whoever owns the project you're working on will have to add the other as a collaborator.

# Goal of Project 2
 - End-to-end testing
 - We'll be making user-stories
	 - so we can create given-when-then scenarios, to try to figure out what to test
	 - "okay, user wants to create a warehouse" followed by "user now wants to add an item"
	 - **For now, we're focusing on BDD**
 - We can use Gherkin syntax to implement these given-when-then scenarios
 - She wants JUnit for all of our backend code
 - Caroline's goal is for us to use Jest to test all of our frontend code

For **Thursday** - 
 - **Decide which of our project we're going to test, and how we're going to test it, have user projects created, do some research for how we're integrating cucumber and selenium (*and now docker*)**
 - "Don't focus so much now on implementation (of user stories), just an outline." "Start very simple, any test case you can think of for how your project could run."
 - Caroline wants an outline for our goals for project 2
 - Discuss a basic plan for how we may plan to accomplish these goals
 - Probably some user stories for project 2?

 - Caroline prefers whatever service is free, if we use one, for documentation
	 - We get to decide what kanban/planning tool we want to use, but we should **run it by Caroline just to make sure it's good/appropriate**
